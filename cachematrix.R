## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse
## which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
       i <- NULL
       set <- function(y){
         x <<- y
         i <<- NULL
       }
       get <- function() x
       setsolve <- function(solve) i <<- solve
       getsolve <- function() i
       list(set = set, get = get,
            setsolve = setsolve,
            getsolve = getsolve)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been 
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        i <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(i)
        i
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
